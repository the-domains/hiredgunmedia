Hired Gun is the birth child of Matt Mitchell, a multi-platform journalist for more than 20 years who works across television, radio, online and print to create compelling stories of interest to a mass audience.
Hired Gun offers the most competitively-priced and comprehensively-tailored media training in Australia. 

Need words written, video produced, audio and podcasts created? We're here for you. No deadline is too scary and we are defeated by no deadline.

We believe media training should be delivered by those still working at the meat of things. In fact, chances are, we produced our last story this very morning. That's our difference. Well, that and we don't rip off our clients.

Having problems getting the media interested in your issue or product even though you have your own media team or engaged PR? Ten bucks says they're doing it wrong or a bunch of 'yes men'. We can help. 

So, if you need a journo/producer/writer/media trainer/head kicker, then hire a gun and get in touch. We travel anywhere.
